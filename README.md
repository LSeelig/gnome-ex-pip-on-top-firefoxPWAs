# gnome-shell-extension-pip-on-top
Makes "Picture-in-Picture" windows stay on top (even on Wayland session). Compatible with Firefox and Clapper media player.

### Installation from source code
Run below in terminal one by one:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
git clone "https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-pip-on-top.git" "pip-on-top@rafostar.github.com"
```
Additionally if you are running Firefox not in English language, execute `translate.sh` script to generate required translations:
```sh
chmod +x translate.sh
./translate.sh
```

After all is done: logout, login back (or reboot) and enable newly installed extension. Enjoy!
